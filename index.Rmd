# Course Description

This course aims to complement existing courses on personality by taking an in-depth look at a number of stereotypically negative personality traits. The course does not assume that these traits are universally negative; it just assumes that these traits are negative when found in most contemporary contexts. The first half of the course will be spent exploring Machiavellianism, narcissism, psychopathy, and sadism. We will discuss these traits in terms of their history, structure, and measurement, as well as potential causes. The second half of the course will be dedicated to discussing negative personality traits with respect to personality disorders, criminality, the workplace, morality, and social media use. 

# Course Format

I will lecture for the first half of class time each week. This is in order to provide a foundation for a discussion of the readings, which will occur during the second half of class time each week. Time permitting, I will also periodically bring in copies of posters I’ve come across at conferences. We will discuss the findings of the posters in light of the week’s readings. 

# Learning Objectives

* Identify and describe negative personality traits at the level of the concept, sub-construct, and  construct. 
* Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the personality constructs and their respective methods of measurement.
* Explore the relationship among the traits.
* Describe competing theories for the presence of these traits in humans.
* Distinguish between subclinical and clinical variations of these traits.
* Examine the relationship between morality and each of the traits. 
* Apply an understanding of the traits to relationship and occupational contexts.
* Develop skills in consuming and critically evaluating research and measurement methods that can be applied to subjects not central to the current course.

# Estimated Student Workload

According to federal policy, a single course credit is equivalent to 30 hours of real student work. This includes (a) time spent physically in the classroom and (b) time spent outside of the classroom working on classwork. A three-credit course, such as this, expects 90 hours of real student work, with 30 of those hours spent in the classroom and 60 of those hours spent working outside of the classroom. Over the current course, it is expected that you will spend 30 hours in the classroom, including the time spent listening to lectures, discussing the readings, and doing the precourse assessment. Outside of the classroom, it is expected that you will spend approximately 30 hours reading course materials (3 hours per week for 10 weeks) and 30 hours completing course exercises, studying for the midterm test, and writing the final paper.

## Attendance and Participation

+ Percent of total grade: 15.00%
+ Due: Assessed throughout the course.
+ Requirements: Students are expected to attend every class and to participate regularly. It is necessary to have read all assigned readings to successfully participate in discussions. If a student notifies the instructor of an absence prior to the class session and participates frequently in class discussions, students may miss up to 10% of the class meetings without negatively impacting their score.

## Precourse Exercise

+ Percent of total grade: 5.00%
+ Due: Completed at the end of the first class (xxx/xx/xxxx).
+ Requirements: The Precourse Exercise assesses your preconceptions regarding the content to be covered in the course. It will be graded on a “pass versus no-pass” basis. For students joining the class after the first day, send me an email before the end of the second week of classes. You will be given an alternative exercise of comparable length to the precourse exercise.  

## The Dark Tetrad Scale Exercise

+ Percent of total grade: 20.00%
+ Due: Uploaded to Canvas by 11:59pm on Friday of Week 4 (xxx/xx/xxxx).
+ Requirements: The Dark Tetrad Scale Exercise aims to assess your understanding of the Dark Triad and its various components. You will be required to design a 40-item Dark Tetrad scale (one item for each of its components) and provide a brief explanation (i.e., one to two sentence) of why you chose to include each item. A template for this assignment can be found on Canvas.

## Midterm Test
+ Percent of total grade: 30.00%
+ Due: First class period of Week 6 (xxx/xx/xxxx).
+ Requirements: The midterm for this course will draw on the material covered in Weeks 1 through 5. It will comprise approximately 50 multiple-choice/short-answer questions. The short-answer questions will require, at maximum, a 1-sentence response. 

## Profile Paper

+ Percent of total grade: 30.00%
+ Due: Uploaded to Canvas by 11:59pm on Friday of Week 10 (xxx/xx/xxxx). 
+ Requirements: The Profile Paper aims to assess your ability to critically and creatively apply course content to describe the personality of a fictional character of your choosing. I suggest that you choose either a villain or an antihero to ensure that your character of interest exhibits negative personality traits. The paper is to be 8-12 double-spaced pages in length, excluding the title page and references, with Times New Roman 12-point font and 2.54cm margins.

I expect the average grade received for this course to be 77-83% with a standard deviation of 14. In order to avoid potential grade inflation and to maintain fairness across different courses at the University of Oregon, I reserve the right to scale grades in order to conform to this distribution.

# Course Policies and Acknowledgements

## Classroom Etiquette

I ask that you help foster a classroom that is free from distractions, respectful of others, and inclusive. If I feel that you have failed to support this effort in any way, I will ask you to leave the classroom. If you feel that someone else has failed to support these efforts, I ask that you contact me (ckay@uoregon.edu) or, if the issue is serious, the office of the Dean of Students (541-346-3216). 

## Technology Use

Note-taking by hand, even for those who do not have a diagnosed learning disability, can often be difficult for students who write slower than their peers. Laptops and cellphones can also be a helpful way to organize your thoughts and to look-up course concepts. I do allow the use of laptops in the classroom, but users of these devices should sit at the ends of rows or at the back of the classroom to avoid the bright screens distracting other students. I do also reserve the right to prohibit laptop and cellphone use for anyone who distracts other students. Laptops, cellphones, and other electronic devices will not be allowed during the midterm test. 

## Reading policy

You are required to do all of the assigned readings prior to class time. Failure to do so will not be assessed directly but will be assessed indirectly through your participation and midterm grade.
	
## Late Assignments 
Late exercises and papers will be docked 10% for each day that they are late. This means, if you turn in the profile paper two days late, you would receive a maximum of 80% for your work. Students may request extensions, but these requests are unlikely to be successful. 

## Email Policy

I tend to check my email twice per day: Once in the morning and once in the evening. However, if you send an email at 7 a.m. on the day of class, I may not respond to it before the class. Please allow at least 24 hours for a response. If I do not respond within 24 hours, it is safe to assume that I did not receive your email, it was erroneously archived, or it was sent to my spam folder. You should resend the email.

## Accessibility

If you require accommodations due to a documented disability, please contact me as soon as possible. You will also need to use the [Accessible Education Center portal](https://aec.uoregon.edu/content/using-aec-connect) to have a notification letter sent to me. If you do not know how to use the portal, please phone 541-346-1155 or email uoaec@uoregon.edu.

## Academic Integrity 

Cheating or plagiarism will result in a grade of F for the course, and UO’s student conduct coordinator will be notified. Cheating includes, but is not necessarily limited to, providing or accepting information during tests. Plagiarism includes, but is not necessarily limited to, quoting or paraphrasing someone else’s ideas without acknowledging the source. If you are unsure of whether a certain behaviour counts as cheating or plagiarism, you should contact me (ckay@uoregon.edu) or the Office of the Dean of Students (phone: 541-346-3216; email: conduct@uoregon.edu).

## Land Acknowledgement

We acknowledge that the University of Oregon is situated on the ancestral territory of the Kalapuya people. We honour the traditional stewards of this land and pay respect to the elders, both past and present.
